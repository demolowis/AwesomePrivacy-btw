<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p/> This is a (somewhat) complete list of software and services, 
that will help you remain private and/or secure online (anonymity will be later).
It has been carefully (or maybe not) handcrafted by me (The Author himself),
however, there is such thing as a silver bullet (100%) when it comes to privacy or security (it depends),
but it will make it harder for anyone to track you online (as far as it is believed to be).
